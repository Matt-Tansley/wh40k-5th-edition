## Space Marines

Some character options let you take a non-troops unit as troops choices. An example is if you have a Space Marine Captain on a bike, then you can take bikes as troops. This is achieved in New Recruit by:

1. Find the ID the Space Marine Bike selection under the Captain in 'Space Marine Library'. 
2. Paste this ID in a 'set hidden true' with '0 selection of X in roster'.
3. This setup means if you select that upgrade, then the unit will appear as an option in the army builder.
